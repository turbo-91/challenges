// I need to write a function sabb
// that counts how often the letters of the word 'sabbatical'
// exist in the provided String. Then I need to store that number in a
// variable, and sum it with the respective variables for val and happiness.
// If the sum is > 22 I return 'Sabbatical! Boom!', else 'Back to your desk, boy.'
